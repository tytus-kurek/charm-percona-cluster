  innodb-file-per-table:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      Turns on innodb_file_per_table option, which will make MySQL put each
      InnoDB table into separate .idb file. Existing InnoDB tables will remain
      in ibdata1 file - full dump/import is needed to get rid of large
      ibdata1 file
  table-open-cache:
    type: int
    default: 2048

      How much data should be kept in memory in the DB. This will be used to
      tune settings in the database server appropriately. Supported suffixes
      include K/M/G/T. If suffixed with %, one will get that percentage of RAM
      allocated to the dataset.
  innodb-buffer-pool-size:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      By default this value will be set according to 50% of system total
      memory or 512MB (whichever is lowest) but also can be set to any specific
      value for the system. Supported suffixes include K/M/G/T. If suffixed
      with %, one will get that percentage of system total memory allocated.
  innodb-change-buffering:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Configure whether InnoDB performs change buffering, an optimization
      that delays write operations to secondary indexes so that the I/O
      operations can be performed sequentially.
      .
      Permitted values include
      .
        none        Do not buffer any operations.
        inserts     Buffer insert operations.
        deletes     Buffer delete marking operations; strictly speaking,
                    the writes that mark index records for later deletion

  innodb-io-capacity:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Configure the InnoDB IO capacity which sets an upper limit on I/O
      activity performed by InnoDB background tasks, such as flushing pages
      from the buffer pool and merging data from the change buffer.
      .
      This value typically defaults to 200 but can be increased on systems
      with fast bus-attached SSD based storage to help the server handle the
      background maintenance work associated with a high rate of row changes.
      .
      Alternatively it can be decreased to a minimum of 100 on systems with
      low speed 5400 or 7200 rpm spindles, to reduce the proportion of IO
      operations being used for background maintenance work.
      .

  max-connections:
    type: int
    default: 600
    description: |
      Maximum connections to allow. A value of -1 means use the server's
      compiled-in default. This is not typically that useful so the
      charm will configure PXC with a default max-connections value of 600.
      Note: Connections take up memory resources. Either at startup time with
      performance-schema=True or during run time with performance-schema=False.
      This value is a balance between connection exhaustion and memory
      exhaustion.
      .
      Consult a MySQL memory calculator like http://www.mysqlcalculator.com/ to
      understand memory resources consumed by connections.
      See also performance-schema.
  wait-timeout:
    type: int
    default: -1
    description: |
      The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a noninteractive
      connection before closing it. -1 means use the server's compiled in
      default.
  root-password:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Root account password for new cluster nodes. Overrides the automatic
      generation of a password for the root user, but must be set prior to
      deployment time to have any effect.
  sst-password:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      SST account password for new cluster nodes. Overrides the automatic
      generation of a password for the sst user, but must be set prior to
      deployment time to have any effect.
  sst-method:
    type: string
    default: xtrabackup-v2
    description: |
      Percona method for taking the State Snapshot Transfer (SST), can be:
      'rsync', 'xtrabackup', 'xtrabackup-v2', 'mysqldump', 'skip' - see

  min-cluster-size:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Minimum number of units expected to exist before charm will attempt to
      bootstrap percona cluster. If no value is provided this setting is
      ignored.
  dns-ha:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Use DNS HA with MAAS 2.0. Note if this is set do not set vip
      settings below.
  vip:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Virtual IP to use to front Percona XtraDB Cluster in active/active HA
      configuration
  vip_iface:

    description: Network interface on which to place the Virtual IP.
  vip_cidr:
    type: int
    default: 24
    description: Netmask that will be used for the Virtual IP.
  ha-bindiface:
    type: string
    default: eth0
    description: |
      Default network interface on which HA cluster will bind to communication
      with the other members of the HA Cluster.
  ha-mcastport:
    type: int
    default: 5490
    description: |
      Default multicast port number that will be used to communicate between HA
      Cluster nodes.
  lp1366997-workaround:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Adds two config options (wsrep_drupal_282555_workaround and
      wsrep_retry_autocommit) as a workaround for Percona Primary Key bug (see
      LP 1366997). Only required for Trusty.
  enable-binlogs:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Turns on MySQL binary logs. The placement of the logs is controlled with
      the binlogs_path config option.
  binlogs-path:
    type: string
    default: /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
    description: |
      Location on the filesystem where binlogs are going to be placed.
      Default mimics what mysql-common package would do for mysql.
      Make sure you do not put binlogs inside mysql datadir (/var/lib/mysql/)!
  binlogs-max-size:
    type: string
    default: 100M
    description: |
      Sets the max_binlog_size mysql configuration option, which will limit the
      size of the binary log files. The server will automatically rotate
      binlogs after they grow to be bigger than this value.
      Keep in mind that transactions are never split between binary logs, so
      therefore binary logs might get larger than configured value.
  binlogs-expire-days:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Sets the expire_logs_days mysql configuration option, which will make
      mysql server automatically remove logs older than configured number of
      days.
  performance-schema:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      The performance schema attempts to automatically size the values of
      several of its parameters at server startup if they are not set
      explicitly. When set to on (True) memory is allocated at startup time.
      The implications of this is any memory related charm config options such
      as max-connections and innodb-buffer-pool-size must be explicitly set for
      the environment percona is running in or percona may fail to start.
      Default to off (False) at startup time giving 5.5 like behavior. The
      implication of this is one can set configuration values that could lead
      to memory exhaustion during run time as memory is not allocated at
      startup time.
  pxc-strict-mode:
    type: string
    default: enforcing
    description: |
      Configures pxc_strict_mode (https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtradb-cluster/LATEST/features/pxc-strict-mode.html)
      Valid values are 'disabled', 'permissive', 'enforcing' and 'master.'
      Defaults to 'enforcing', as this is what PXC5.7 on bionic (and above)
      does.
      This option is ignored on PXC < 5.7 (xenial defaults to 5.6, trusty
      defaults to 5.5)
  tuning-level:
    type: string
    default: safest
    description: |
      Valid values are 'safest', 'fast', and 'unsafe'. If set to 'safest', all
      settings are tuned to have maximum safety at the cost of performance.
      'fast' will turn off most controls, but may lose data on crashes.
      'unsafe' will turn off all protections but this may be OK in clustered
      deployments.
  # Network config (by default all access is over 'private-address')
  access-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the 'access' network (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      This network will be used for access to database services.
  os-access-hostname:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The hostname or address of the access endpoint for percona-cluster.
  cluster-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the cluster (replication) network (e.g.
      192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      This network will be used for wsrep_cluster replication.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  # Monitoring config
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm. A string that will
      be prepended to instance name to set the host name in nagios. So for
      instance the hostname would be something like 'juju-myservice-0'. If
      you are running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios service groups.
      If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup
  modulo-nodes:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      This config option is rarely required but is provided for fine tuning, it
      is safe to leave unset. Modulo nodes is used to help avoid restart
      collisions as well as distribute load on the cloud at larger scale.
      During restarts and cluster joins percona needs to execute these
      operations serially. By setting modulo-nodes to the size of the cluster
      and known-wait to a reasonable value, the charm will distribute the
      operations serially. If this value is unset, the charm will check
      min-cluster-size or else finally default to the size of the cluster
      based on peer relations. Setting this value to 0 will execute operations
      with no wait time. Setting this value to less than the cluster size will
      distribute load but may lead to restart collisions.
  known-wait:
    type: int
    default: 30
    description: |
      Known wait along with modulo nodes is used to help avoid restart
      collisions. Known wait is the amount of time between one node executing
      an operation and another. On slower hardware this value may need to be
      larger than the default of 30 seconds.
  peer-timeout:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
        This setting sets the gmcast.peer_timeout value. Possible values are documented
        on the galera cluster site http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/galeraparameters.html
        For very busy clouds or in resource restricted environments this value can be changed.
        WARNING Please read all documentation before changing the default value which may have
        unintended consequences. It may be necessary to set this value higher during deploy time
        (PT15S) and subsequently change it back to the default (PT3S) after deployment.
  databases-to-replicate:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Semicolon-separated list of databases and tables to replicate using MySQL
      asynchronous replication. For example "database1:table1,table2;database2"
      will replicate "table1" and "table2" tables from "database1" databasae
      and all tables from "database2" database.
      .
      NOTE: This option should be used only when relating one cluster to the
      other. It does not affect Galera synchronous replication. 
  cluster-id:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Cluster ID to be used when using MySQL asynchronous replication.
      .
      NOTE: This value must be different for each cluster.
